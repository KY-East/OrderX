## üöÄ Launch Philosophy

The Order X Protocol isn't just another product launch‚Äîit's a carefully orchestrated community activation sequence. Our approach follows three core principles:

1. **Community First**: Build engagement before functionality
2. **Test-Measure-Scale**: Validate each component before expanding
3. **Momentum Cultivation**: Create escalating energy through strategic milestones

This 90-day plan transforms Order X from concept to movement through precise, coordinated execution.
